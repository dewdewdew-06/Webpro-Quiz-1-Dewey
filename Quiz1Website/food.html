        <h1>Local Food</h1>
        <p>
            Balinese cuisine is very diverse where dishes are flavourful and full of spices. 
            One of the most famous dishes is Nasi Campur, which combines rice with vegetables, 
            meat, peanuts, eggs, and fried shrimp. Another specialty is Babi Guling, a roasted 
            suckling pig seasoned with turmeric and other local spices. Satay Lilit, a unique 
            Balinese satay made from minced fish wrapped around lemongrass sticks, is also a must-try. 
            Together, these dishes reflect the rich culture and traditions of Bali, combining fresh 
            ingredients with bold flavors.
